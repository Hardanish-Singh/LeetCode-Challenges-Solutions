"""
A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. 
The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to any leaf node.

To determine if a binary tree is height-balanced, we need to check two conditions for every node:
        1) The left subtree and right subtree must be balanced.
        2) The height difference between the left and right subtrees should not exceed 1.

If both conditions hold true for all nodes, then the tree is height-balanced.
