/*
        SQL Schema
        In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others' requests as well.

        

        Table request_accepted

        +--------------+-------------+------------+
        | requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
        |--------------|-------------|------------|
        | 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
        | 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
        | 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
        | 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
        +--------------+-------------+------------+
        This table holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.
        

        Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number under the following rules:

        It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
        The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.
        For the sample data above, the result is:

        Result table:
        +------+------+
        | id   | num  |
        |------|------|
        | 3    | 3    |
        +------+------+
        The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
