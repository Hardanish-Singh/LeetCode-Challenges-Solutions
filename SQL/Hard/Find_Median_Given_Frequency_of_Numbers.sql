-- Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-given-frequency-of-numbers/

-- IDEA BEHIND SOLUTION 1
-- Unnesting the numbers(num) using WITH RECURSIVE
-- Finding Total Number of Rows
-- Checking if total number of rows is even or odd
-- Formula if even number of rows is AVG(total/2, total/2 + 1)
-- Formula if odd number of rows is AVG(total/2 + 1)

-- Solution 1
WITH RECURSIVE recursive_cte AS (
  SELECT
    num,
    frequency,
    1 AS cnt
  FROM Numbers
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    num,
    frequency, 
    cnt + 1 AS cnt
  FROM recursive_cte
  WHERE cnt < Frequency
), CTE1 AS (
    SELECT 
      num,
      frequency,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER( ORDER BY num ) AS rn,
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recursive_cte) AS total
    FROM 
      recursive_cte 
    ORDER BY num
), CTE2 AS (
      SELECT 
        *,
        CASE 
          WHEN MOD(total, 2) = 0 AND rn = (total/2) OR rn = (total/2) + 1 THEN 'T'
          WHEN MOD(total, 2) != 0 AND rn = (total/2) THEN 'T'

        END AS flag
      FROM CTE1
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(num), 1) AS median 
FROM CTE2
